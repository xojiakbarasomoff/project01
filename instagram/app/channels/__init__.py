"""Channel adapters, and the registration that makes them findable.

Importing this package is what puts an adapter in the registry, so anything
resolving a channel by type (app.services.delivery) imports from here rather
than from a concrete platform module.

Both channels the product serves are registered below. A third would be one
more line here and one more package beside them, with nothing else in the
codebase changing.
