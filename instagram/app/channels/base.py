"""The contract every messaging platform is reached through.

This package is the one place in the codebase allowed to know that
"Instagram" (or, once the Telegram bot merges in, "Telegram") exists as a
concrete thing. Everything under app/services and app/rag is written against
this interface instead, so adding a platform means adding an adapter here,
not touching the answer pipeline, the debounce logic, or the conversation
store.

The split mirrors the one already used for LLMProvider/EmbeddingProvider
(app/rag/llm.py, app/rag/embeddings.py): an ABC for the capability, concrete
implementations behind it, and a lookup that callers use so they never name
an implementation directly.
