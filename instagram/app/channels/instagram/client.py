# permission error, so a misrouted send fails in a way that reads like a
# corrupt token instead of a wrong host. Switching to a Facebook Page token
# (an "EAA" token, issued through Facebook Login) would mean moving this
# back and re-subscribing the account; the two hosts are not
# interchangeable per-request.

# skip sending instead of hammering Meta with 401s.
