"""First-run provisioning of everything a deployment needs to be usable:
the tenant, its Instagram and Telegram channels, and the first dashboard
login.

The scripts under scripts/ do the same things from an operator's shell, and
stay the right tool wherever one is available. This exists because on a
managed host the database is reachable only from inside the cluster's private
network: the sole process that can write these rows is the application itself,
so provisioning has to be something the app can do on its own behalf, driven
by configuration.

Runs on web startup only (app.main's lifespan), never in the worker, so two
processes booting from the same image cannot race to insert the same row.
Every step is idempotent and none of them is fatal -- a deployment that
cannot provision must still serve, because the webhook traffic it drops
while refusing to start is not recoverable and the provisioning problem is.

Four independent switches, each armed by setting its variables and safely
left armed afterwards:

* PROVISION_TENANT_NAME -- the clinic every other step attaches to. Nothing
  below happens without it.
* PROVISION_IG_ACCOUNT_ID (+ ACCESS_TOKEN) -- the Instagram channel.
* PROVISION_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN (+ PUBLIC_BASE_URL) -- the Telegram channel,
  including registering the webhook with Telegram.
* PROVISION_OPERATOR_USERNAME + PROVISION_OPERATOR_PASSWORD -- the first
  dashboard login, without which a freshly deployed dashboard cannot be
  opened at all.
