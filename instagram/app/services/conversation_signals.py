"""What the assistant can already tell about a conversation before it answers.

The prompt used to state its two social rules unconditionally: return the
greeting, and close by asking for a phone number. Applied to every turn,
that produces a correspondent who says hello five times and ends every
single message asking for a number nobody is refusing to give -- which reads
as a machine running a script, and makes the request itself easy to ignore.

Both rules are really conditional, and the conditions are things code can
establish more reliably than a model reading its own history: is this the
first message, has a number already been given, and have we asked before.
Establishing them here keeps the prompt free of "work out whether you have
already asked", which is exactly the kind of self-inspection models are
worst at.

None of this is a hard gate. The signals are rendered into the prompt as
facts, and the rules that use them are written so the failure mode is
asking too little rather than too much -- a patient who is never asked can
still be asked next turn, while a patient asked in every message has already
decided what this is.
