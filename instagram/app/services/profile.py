"""Put a name to the patient the dashboard is showing.

Instagram delivers a message with the sender's id and nothing else, so until
now a conversation in the dashboard was headed "17841467434701445". The
operator reading that screen cannot recognise a patient by it, cannot search
for one, and cannot match the row to the person telephoning them -- which
makes the busiest screen in the clinic the one that identifies nobody.

The account's own messaging permission is enough to ask Instagram for the
sender's handle, and one lookup per patient is enough for good: the handle is
stored on the patient row, and a patient who already has one is never looked
up again.

Everything here is best-effort by construction. A message must be answered
whether or not the lookup works, so every failure path ends in the patient
keeping their id as a label -- which is what the dashboard showed anyway.
