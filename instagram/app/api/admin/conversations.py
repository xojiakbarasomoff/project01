"""Reading patient conversations, and taking one over.

Operator takeover is the feature this makes real. `Conversation.is_bot_enabled`
existed as a column nothing read, so switching the bot off had no effect;
both inbound edges now check it before answering, and this is where a human
turns it off and starts replying themselves.
