# HNSW/IVFFlat indexes (verified against pgvector 0.8.6) -- so the vectors are
# indexable as they come, with no truncation.

# The name is written onto every row it embeds (KnowledgeBase.embedding_model).
# Vectors are only comparable to vectors from the same model, so a row embedded
# by something else is not a slightly worse match, it is a meaningless one --
# and knowing which model made a row is what lets ingest_faqs repair it instead
# of the clinic finding out through a bot that suddenly knows nothing.
