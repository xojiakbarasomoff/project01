"""Background jobs: turn a recorded inbound message into a sent reply.

Platform-neutral. The job arguments carry a channel id rather than anything
Instagram-shaped, the reply goes out through app.services.delivery (which
dispatches on the channel's type), and every step in between — retrieval,
guardrails, the answer prompt, the transcript — is shared business logic.
The Telegram bot's inbound edge enqueues these same two jobs.

    Runs in the worker process, not the request that received the webhook —
    that request's DB session and tenant context don't survive past its 200
    response, so this re-establishes both from the plain, serializable
    arguments the inbound edge enqueued (a UUID isn't one of those, hence
    the ids arrive as str and are parsed back here).

    The channel id is carried explicitly rather than looked up from the
    tenant, so the reply always goes out over the account the patient
    actually wrote to — see app.services.delivery for what the previous
    "first active channel" lookup got wrong.

    session_factory defaults to app.core.db.db_session (a genuinely fresh
    session against the real engine — in production this job never receives
    one from a caller). It is injectable for the same reason
    embedding_provider/llm_provider/adapter are: tests call this function
    directly, bypassing the queue. That is not just convenience — a *second*,
    independent db_session() in a test cannot see that test's own uncommitted
    fixture data, so tests must be able to point the job at the same
